# ML-tree-species-classification

Use Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery to derive the dominant tree species for forests in Germany using a machine-learning approach.

Reference Data:

The German tree species data of EU-Forest (Mauri et al., 2017) is used as the reference data, which contains a total of 84 tree species and 67,412 sample plots.

File1 contains the coordinates (X, Y) and the name (SPECIES NAME) of the tree species.

File2 is the statistical result of File 1, which counts the number of occurrences of each tree species and sorts them.
